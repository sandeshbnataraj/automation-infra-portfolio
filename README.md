# **DevOps Automation Portfolio ðŸš€**

*Showcasing practical automation across pipelines, artifacts, and database delivery*

## **About This Portfolio**

This portfolio highlights my work in **automation and systems design** â€” projects that manage pipelines, artifacts, and database releases in **reliable, scalable, and secure ways**. The goal is to build solutions that deliver **consistency, traceability, and efficiency** across the software lifecycle, while ensuring automation is designed with **security and resilience** from the start.

## **1. Python DevOps Tools**

Automation utilities built in Python for pipelines, artifacts, and database releases.

### ðŸ”¹ [GitLab Pilot](https://github.com/sandeshbnataraj/gitlab_pilot)

*A CLI to automate GitLab CI/CD pipeline management*

* Trigger, monitor, and manage pipelines from the command line.
* Inject CI/CD variables dynamically and download artifacts.
* Parse `.gitlab-ci.yml` to list jobs/stages available for triggering.
* Streamline workflows across multiple GitLab projects.

### ðŸ”¹ [GitLab Jar Manager](https://github.com/sandeshbnataraj/gitlab_jar_manager)

*Artifact management for `.jar` files in GitLab*

* Upload/download Java artifacts with GitLabâ€™s Maven Package Registry.
* Maintain `library.json` manifests for artifact traceability.
* Handle nested directories and multi-project workflows.
* Designed for seamless integration with Java build pipelines.

### ðŸ”¹ [DB Release Builder](https://github.com/sandeshbnataraj/db_release_builder)

*Automating structured database release packaging in CI/CD*

* Collects changed SQL scripts and applies standardized headers.
* Generates permission scripts, version updates, and deployment guides.
* Produces structured release bundles for AGT/AWB databases.
* Runs inside CI/CD â€” bundles are packaged into Docker images and pushed to GitLab registry.

## **Why This Matters**

High-performing engineering organizations succeed not just through great code, but through the **systems that deliver that code safely, repeatably, and at scale**.

This portfolio demonstrates the core principles of building those systems:

* **Consistency** â†’ pipelines, artifacts, and database changes follow predictable patterns.
* **Traceability** â†’ every build and release is versioned and auditable.
* **Scalability** â†’ workflows can expand across teams and environments without fragility.
* **Reliability** â†’ automation reduces human error, accelerates delivery, and increases confidence.
* **Security** â†’ guardrails, access controls, and safe defaults ensure automation protects as much as it enables.

This portfolio reflects the ability to design and operate **secure, scalable delivery systems** â€” the kind that underpin DevOps, SRE, Cloud, and Infrastructure roles where engineering impact directly drives business outcomes.
