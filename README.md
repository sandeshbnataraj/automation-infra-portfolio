# **Automation & Infrastructure Portfolio ðŸš€**

### *Exploring how complex engineering challenges can be solved at scale.*

---

# **Executive Summary**

I design and operate **secure, scalable, and automated platforms** that take ideas from commit to production with **speed, reliability, and confidence**. My expertise spans **cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and infrastructure as code** â€” always focused on building systems that are **production-ready, auditable, and resilient at scale**.

This portfolio is a **living showcase** of that mindset: continuously evolving and expanding. Alongside my proven infrastructure and DevOps projects, Iâ€™m now **pivoting into ML/AI infrastructure and platform engineering**, building the foundations that power the next generation of intelligent systems.

If youâ€™re looking for someone who can **architect, automate, and optimize modern infrastructure end-to-end â€” and grow into AI-driven platforms â€” youâ€™ve found them.**

## **What This Portfolio Represents**

This portfolio is a window into the kind of engineering I value most: **building systems that make software delivery faster, safer, and more reliable**.

It isnâ€™t just a set of scripts or repositories â€” itâ€™s a collection of ideas put into practice, where challenges are broken down and solved in ways that scale. Each project represents a different angle on a single theme: delivering software with **consistency, security, and confidence**.

More than a set of tools, this portfolio reflects a way of thinking: **designing systems that are consistent, trustworthy, and built to last**.

## **1. CI/CD & Containerization Projects**

End-to-end delivery pipelines and containerization patterns showcasing reproducibility, security, and scale.

### ðŸ”¹ [Microservices DevOps Playground](https://github.com/sandeshbnataraj/microservices-devops-playground)

*Monorepo CI/CD, polyglot Dockerfiles, and Docker Swarm stack with Traefik*

* Root `.gitlab-ci.yml` orchestrates **per-service builds** (Node, Python, Go, .NET).
* Uses **Buildx** for SHA-tagged, reproducible builds â€” with **multi-arch** support (amd64 + arm64).
* Each service has a **production-minded Dockerfile** aligned with its language ecosystem.
* Includes **Swarm stack** (`compose.yml`) and **Traefik reverse proxy** (`traefik.yml`) with health checks, VIP networking, and rolling/rollback configs.

```text
[ GitLab CI ]
   â””â”€ buildx jobs per service (Node, Python, Go, .NET)
        â””â”€ tag with SHA + push to registry
             â””â”€ Swarm stack deploy (compose.yml + traefik.yml)
                  â””â”€ Traefik routes + health checks + rolling updates
```

### ðŸ”¹ [PipelineOps](https://github.com/sandeshbnataraj/pipelineops)

*Reusable GitLab CI/CD components for container builds*

* Parameterized **Buildx** component template for standardized builds.
* Inputs: Dockerfile path, context, image name/tag, build target, driver.
* Centralized updates improve every pipeline that consumes it.

```text
Consumer project â”€â”€ include: pipelineops/template.yml
                     â”‚
                     â–¼
                .buildx-build job
                     â”‚
                     â–¼
           docker buildx build --push
                     â”‚
                     â–¼
           GitLab Container Registry
```

## **Why This Matters**

High-performing engineering organizations succeed not just through great code, but through the **systems that deliver that code safely, repeatably, and at scale**.

This portfolio demonstrates the core principles of building those systems:

* **Consistency** â†’ pipelines, artifacts, and database changes follow predictable patterns.
* **Traceability** â†’ every build and release is versioned and auditable.
* **Scalability** â†’ workflows expand across teams and environments without fragility.
* **Reliability** â†’ automation reduces human error and increases confidence.
* **Security** â†’ guardrails and safe defaults ensure automation protects as much as it enables.

This portfolio reflects the ability to design and operate **secure, scalable delivery systems** â€” the kind that underpin DevOps, Cloud, and Infrastructure roles where engineering impact directly drives business outcomes.
